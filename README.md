# Project RAHAT

## Problem Statement
Approximately 60 to 70 million people in India are suffering from common and severe mental disorders, making it a significant public health concern in the country and according to WHO, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide.

Mental health disorders are on the rise globally, impacting individuals of all ages and backgrounds.
Access to mental health services remains limited, and stigma surrounding mental illness persists.

The Orkes Timestamp Integration feature provides a seamless way to retrieve timestamps for workflow executions within our application. By leveraging Orkes, we ensure accurate timestamp data is readily available for monitoring and analyzing workflow executions, paving the way for enhanced user experience and system performance. Though currently implemented, this feature has yet to be fully integrated into our pipeline. Once integrated, it will empower us to track and optimize workflow performance efficiently, leading to improved service delivery and user satisfaction. 

## Challenges Faced
During the development of RAHAT, we encountered challenges typical of any complex project. One specific hurdle we faced was integrating real-time data updates seamlessly into the user interface. This required careful synchronization between the client and server-side components, especially when dealing with dynamic content such as user-generated posts and updates from external APIs.

To overcome this challenge, we adopted a structured approach, leveraging the capabilities of React.js and Firebase to manage data flow efficiently. We meticulously debugged our code, identifying and resolving any inconsistencies in data transmission. Additionally, we conducted thorough testing at each stage of development to ensure smooth functionality across various scenarios.
