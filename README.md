The Orkes Timestamp Integration feature provides a seamless way to retrieve timestamps for workflow executions within our application. By leveraging Orkes, we ensure accurate timestamp data is readily available for monitoring and analyzing workflow executions, paving the way for enhanced user experience and system performance. Though currently implemented, this feature has yet to be fully integrated into our pipeline. Once integrated, it will empower us to track and optimize workflow performance efficiently, leading to improved service delivery and user satisfaction.
